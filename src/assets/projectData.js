The site is meant to show the community of mesh users around the world – backers of the kickstarter campaign would register their new devices and add them to the map.  A mesh network gets more powerful as more people join, and seeing the active users is an encouragement to join the network.",

In this alternate reality, advances in artificial intelligence have allowed our devices to break the barrier to autonomy.

How would you experience your computer mouse if it could react to your internet browsing habits? This project consists of a series of experiments blending hardware, software, design fiction, and a touch of absurdity. These objects will seek to contextualize our current technical ecology, and initiate critical discussion about its future direction.",

Mycelium grows around a substrate of agricultural byproducts, such as corn husk, to naturally create the forms.  The pieces were then assembled, which grew together into this final structure.  The piece was meant to imitate the MDF and particle board so prevalent throughout the IKEA collection, materials which are resource-intensive and toxic to create. Instead, it is now possible to naturally grow a substitute. Completely biodegradable, the shelf can also be broken apart and placed in your garden when its useful lifespan has ended.",
